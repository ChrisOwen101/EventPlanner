NG Stories: Making a National Gallery	Free	"Immerse yourself in 200 years of extraordinary National Gallery stories.
From a resident family of 14 and an intrepid travelling agent to ground-breaking scientists and a wartime pianist, NG Stories tells the history of the National Gallery through the people who made us what we are today.
There’s a slate mine in Wales where paintings were safely stored during the Second World War. A guard dog who became a member of staff. And a Keeper’s family, with 14 children, who lived in the building and kept diaries.
You’ll discover some of the untold personal stories of the Gallery and the special memories we have been privileged to help create for our visitors. From childhood adventures to life-changing first art encounters, our visitors have always been at the heart of what we do.
Through magical soundscapes and immersive digital interactions, you'll experience the work of the many people here at the Gallery who help to care for the paintings and see how this work has changed over the years.
This experience, both online and in the Gallery, uses digital technology to tell you the unexpected human stories which have shaped the past and present of our 200-year history."	Unknown	12 January 2025
